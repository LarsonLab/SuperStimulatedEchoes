# Super Stimulated Echoes for MRI

Matlab code for generating and simulating super stimulated echoes for MRI.

**Warning**: This is just a dump of code from more than a couple years ago, so not very organized or documented.  Updates will be made if used more and are appreciated if you have ideas.

## Functions to check out

design_sSTE_inv - designs prep pulse for trying maximize MZ encoding during stimulated echo

calc_sste_diff - estimates diffusion encoding based on EPG simulation

ste_se_sim - simulations of performance comparisons between spin-echo and stimulated-echo (including super stimulated echo) diffusion encoding
